# jscourse
A repository so I can host my Javascript projects while I learn. Started learning JS on December 19, 2022. I uploaded all my projects on <a href="https://codepen.io/bluedrxgs">my Codepen</a>, but on June 27, 2023,  I decided to move them  to GitHub,  so I can organize myself better, access my code, and share my progress.
